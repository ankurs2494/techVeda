title: "Zero-Trust in Cloud: PrivateLink + IAM"

This page explains how Zero-Trust is implemented in the cloud using PrivateLink and IAM. 

It shows why private network access alone is not sufficient and how identity and policy enforcement control access.

PrivateLink reduces network exposure, while IAM ensures authentication and authorization per request. Together, they form a true Zero-Trust architecture.

---

### 1️⃣ The Core Zero-Trust Rule (Cloud Version)

    Network reachability ≠ access

**In Zero-Trust cloud:** 
- Private IP does not mean trusted
- VPC peering does not mean trusted
- Only identity + policy grants access

---

### 2️⃣ What Problem PrivateLink Solves

   **Without PrivateLink**  (Traditional) 

   `bash
       Service → Public IP → Internet → Client
   ` 

   **Problems:** 
   - Public exposure
   - IP allowlists
   - Attack surface
   
   **With PrivateLink**  (Zero-Trust Friendly)
   
   `bash
       Client VPC → Private Endpoint → Service
   `

   - No public IP
   - Traffic stays on provider backbone
   - Network exposure minimized

---

### 3️⃣ What PrivateLink Actually Is (Mental Model)

PrivateLink is a private entry point, not a trust mechanism.

**It provides:** 
- Private connectivity
- Isolation
- No internet exposure

**It does NOT provide:**
- ❌ Authentication
- ❌ Authorization

That’s where IAM comes in.

---

### 4️⃣ IAM = Identity & Authorization Layer

**IAM answers:** 
- Who is calling?
- What are they allowed to do?

**IAM is:** 
- Identity-based
- Policy-driven
- Independent of network

---

 ### 5️⃣ Zero-Trust Architecture (End-to-End)
```
        Client (Workload / User)
             ↓
        IAM Identity (Role / Service Account) 
             ↓ 
        PrivateLink (Private Connectivity) 
             ↓ 
        Service Endpoint
             ↓ 
        Policy Enforcement
```

> If identity ≠ allowed → DENY

---

### 6️⃣ Concrete Example (Cloud-Agnostic)

#### Let's consider a scenario: 
- App in VPC-A
- Database/API in VPC-B
- Zero-Trust requirement

#### Step 1: PrivateLink
- Expose service via PrivateLink
- No public IP
- Only reachable via private endpoint

#### Step 2: IAM Authentication
- Client uses:
  - IAM role
  - Service identity
- Requests are signed or token-based

#### Step 3: Authorization Policy

#### Example:
- Allow role:orders-service
- Action: ReadOrders

> Not allowed → rejected even though network path exists

---

### 7️⃣ Why This Is Zero-Trust (Key Insight)

**Traditional:** 
IP allowed → access granted

**Zero-Trust:** 
IP allowed → identity checked → policy evaluated → access granted

- PrivateLink = path
- IAM = permission

---

### 8️⃣ Common Cloud Patterns

**→ Internal API** 
- PrivateLink endpoint
- IAM-authenticated requests
- No security group allowlists

**→ SaaS Access** 
- SaaS exposes PrivateLink
- Customer accesses privately
- IAM controls tenant access

**→ Cross-Account Access** 
- No VPC peering
- No shared networks
- Identity-based access only

---

### 9️⃣ Failure Scenarios (Very Important)

❌ Can connect but get 403
Cause:
- IAM policy denies action

❌ Endpoint reachable but handshake fails
Cause:
- Wrong role
- Missing permission

❌ Works from one service, not another
Cause:
- Different identities
- Policy mismatch

> 💡 These look like network issues, but they’re identity issues.

---

### Interview-Grade Explanation
“PrivateLink provides private connectivity, reducing attack surface, while IAM enforces Zero-Trust by validating identity and authorization per request. Access is never granted based on network location alone.”

---

### Final Mental Model (Memorize This)

- PrivateLink = How traffic reaches the service
- IAM        = Whether traffic is allowed

---

### When to Use PrivateLink + IAM

Use when:

- Internal APIs
- Cross-VPC / cross-account access
- SaaS integrations
- Zero-Trust architectures

---

### Avoid relying on:
- ❌ IP allowlists
- ❌ Flat VPC trust
